-- HTTP request-response cycle when URL gets hit what happening

When you enter a URL in a browser and hit enter, a series of steps, collectively known as the HTTP request-response cycle, takes place. 
Heres a simplified overview:

URL Parsing: The browser parses the URL to extract information like the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), domain, and path.

DNS Resolution: The browser resolves the domain name to an IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS).

TCP Handshake: A TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection is established between the browser and the server.

HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server. This includes the method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and the path specified 
in the URL.

Server Processing: The server receives the request, processes it, and generates an appropriate response.

HTTP Response: The server sends back an HTTP response, which includes status codes, headers, and the requested content (HTML, images, etc.).

Rendering: The browser renders the received content, displaying it to the user.

This entire process happens in a matter of milliseconds, enabling users to interact with websites seamlessly.

-- TCP VS UDP
Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless:

TCP: Connection-oriented. It establishes a reliable, bidirectional communication channel before data exchange.
UDP: Connectionless. It does not establish a connection before sending data, providing a faster but less reliable communication.
Reliability:

TCP: Reliable. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order through mechanisms like acknowledgments and retransmission of lost packets.
UDP: Unreliable. It does not guarantee delivery or order of packets; some packets may be lost without retransmission.
Flow Control and Congestion Control:

TCP: Implements flow control and congestion control mechanisms to manage data transfer efficiently and avoid network congestion.
UDP: Does not have built-in mechanisms for flow control or congestion control.
Header Size:

TCP: Larger header size due to additional control information for reliability.
UDP: Smaller header size as it carries less control information.
Usage Scenarios:

TCP: Used for applications requiring reliable and ordered delivery of data, such as web browsing, email, and file transfer (FTP).
UDP: Suitable for real-time applications where low latency is crucial, like streaming media, online gaming, and VoIP.


-- Diff B/w find & filter method
filter() method returns the matched values in the array from the collection
find() method returns the first value that matches from the collection. Once it matches the value in finding, it will
not check the remaining values in the array collection 


--------------- HTML:----------

-- Web Page:

Content Focus: Web pages primarily display static content for information consumption.

Limited Interaction: Interactions are basic, like clicking links and filling out forms.

Lightweight: Web pages are lightweight, load quickly, and are optimized for content delivery.

Examples: Blogs, news sites, and informational websites are common web page examples.

Minimal Data Handling: They store minimal user data and typically dont require user accounts.

-- Web App:

Functionality Focus: Web apps are interactive and dynamic, offering complex functionality.

Rich Interaction: Users can perform advanced tasks, including real-time updates and data manipulation.

Sophisticated UI: They often have advanced UI features and may use JavaScript frameworks.

Examples: Social media platforms, email services, and online productivity tools are typical web app examples.

Data Handling: Web apps involve data storage and user accounts, often relying on databases for content.


<!-- -------------------**\_\_\_**HTML Posssible Questions****\_****------------ -->

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document & version.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page it defines the whole HTML document.
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page such as character set, viewport setting & page title
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page which is shown in the browsers title bar
or in the pages tab.
The <body> element defines the documents body, and is a container for all the visible contents, 
such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

-- DOM
The Document Object Model, commonly referred to as the DOM, is a platform and language neutral programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically. In simpler terms, its a way for 
developers to interact with and manipulate web pages using code typically js.

-- Div VS Section VS Article VS Span: 
division : container for grouping elements together. 
section : it typically contains multiple paragraphs, headings, images, and other content.
article : should have a unique topic, be complete in itself.
span : tag is often used in combination with CSS to style text or apply special effects, such as changing the 
       font color or background color of a particular word or phrase

-- inline 
elements are elements that take up the do not occupy full width of their parent container that means does not start on 
a new line. eg: <span> tag

-- block elements
elements are elements that take up the full width of their parent container and create a new line 
after themselves that means always start on a new line and browser automatically add some space before and after the 
element. eg: <p>, <div> 

-- OVERFLOW
The overflow property can be set to one of the following values:
visible: This is the default value.It allows the content to overflow the elements box & any overflowing 
content will be visible outside of the box.

hidden: used to hide any content that exceeds the dimension of the element. No scroll bar will appear & that 
exceed content will be hidden. 

scroll: will always display the both horizontal & vertical scrollbar, whether the content overflow or not.
This ensure that the user can scroll to see any hidden content. 

auto: Auromatically display the scrollbar if the content exceed the dimension otherwise no scrollbar are shown 
its the combination of both hidden and scroll & providing the scrollbar only when needed.

-- META TAG:
In HTML, the meta tag is used to provide metadata about a web page. Metadata is information about 
the page that is not displayed on the page itself but is used by browsers, search engines, and other applications 
to understand and categorize the content of the page.
Some common attributes include:

charset: specifies the character encoding used by the page
name: specifies the type of metadata, such as "description", "keywords", or "author"
content: specifies the actual metadata value
-- eg
-- <head>
--   <meta charset="UTF-8">
--   <meta name="description" content="This is a description of the page.">
-- </head>

-- View port 
In HTML, the viewport meta tag is used to control the way a web page is displayed on mobile devices and in responsive web design. 
The viewport meta tag helps define the visible area of the web page and sets the initial zoom level.
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

-- MEDIA QUERY
Media queries allow you to specify different styles for different screen sizes, resolutions, orientations, 
and other device characteristics. Media queries are written using the @media 

-- Semantic tags
Semantic tags are used to represent the different parts of a web page in a meaningful way.

<header>: Represents the top section of a web page, typically containing the site logo, navigation, and other introductory elements.
<nav>: Defines a navigation menu for a web page.
<main>: Represents the primary content of a web page, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars.
<section>: Defines a thematic grouping of content within a web page.
<article>: Represents a self-contained composition within a document, such as a blog post or news article.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the surrounding content, often placed in a sidebar.
<footer>: Represents the bottom section of a web page, typically containing copyright information, contact details, and other closing elements.

-- Non-Semantic Tags:
Non-semantic tags do not convey any specific meaning or structure to the content. They are typically used for layout and formatting purposes. 
Non-semantic tags are less informative and do not provide any context to the content they enclose. Examples of non-semantic tags include:

<div>: Used for creating generic divisions or containers for styling and layout.
<span>: Used for inline styling or to target specific portions of text.
<b>: Used for bold text (though <strong> is a semantic alternative for important text).
<i>: Used for italicized text (though <em> is a semantic alternative for emphasized text)

-- iframe 
The <iframe> tag in HTML stands for "inline frame" and is used to embed another web document or webpage within the current document. 
<iframe src="URL_of_external_page" width="width" height="height" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

-- Formatting tags
HTML provides various tags and elements for formatting and styling the content of a web page. These formatting 
tags are often used to control the presentation of text and other elements on the page.
<b></b>, <i></i>, <u></u>, <font></font>, <br></br>, <center></center/>, <hr></hr>, <sub></sub>, <strike></strike> andso on.

-- Attribute
HTML attributes are always specified in the format attribute="value". Here are some common attributes and their purposes:

id: The id attribute provides a unique identifier for an HTML element within a document. It is used to target and style specific 
elements with CSS or to link to them with JavaScript
<div id="unique-element">This is a unique element.</div>

like that class, title, src, href, alt etc.


------------------ CSS:-------------

-- GRID
Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and
columns divide the container into 12 equal parts using CSS Grid.

-- FLEX
Flexbox is primarily used for one-dimensional layouts, such as arranging items in a row or column.
It is ideal for creating layouts that need to be flexible and responsive, such as navigation menus or flexible forms.

-- TRANSFORM
The transform property in CSS is used to apply a variety of visual transformations to elements, such as
 rotating, scaling, translating, or skewing them. 

-- pesudo class
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

-- Position
Position property is used to control the positioning of an elements within its container element

Static: This is the default value. Elements are positioned according to the noraml flow of the document.
Relative: Element is positioned relative to its normal position.
Absolute: Elements is removed from the normal flow & positioned is calculated by relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
Fixed: Element is removed from the normal flow & its position is calculated by relative to the browser window. It stay fixed even when scrolling the pages.
Sticky: Element is treated as relative position untill it crosses a specified point during scrolling, then it is treated as fixed positioned.

-- Box Model:
The box model is a fundamental concept in web design and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
It describes how elements on a web page are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated. 
The box model consists of four main components:

Content: This is the innermost part of an element and represents the actual content, such as text, images, or other media.

Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the elements border. It provides spacing and separation between the
content and the border. Padding can be adjusted using CSS properties like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.

Border: The border is a line or outline that surrounds the content and padding. It creates a visual boundary for the 
element. Borders can have different styles, colors, and widths, which can be controlled with CSS properties like border-style, border-color, and border-width.

Margin: Margin is the space outside the elements border, providing separation between the element and neighboring 
elements. It controls the spacing between elements on a web page. Margins can be adjusted using CSS properties like margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.

Here a simple representation of the box model:

---------------------------
|       Margin            |
|   -------------------   |
|   |      Border      |  |
|   |    ------------  |  |
|   |   |  Padding  |  |  |
|   |   |           |  |  |
|   |   |  Content  |  |  |
|   |   |           |  |  |
|   |   |           |  |  |
|   |   -------------  |  |
|   -------------------   |
|       Margin            |
---------------------------
-------------------Javascript:-----------------
-- JavaScript:

Programming Language: JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for both front-end and back-end web development. 
Its supported by all modern web browsers and is a fundamental technology for web development.

Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, which means it runs in the users web browser. 
It enables dynamic and interactive features on web pages, such as form validation, animations, and real-time updates.

Language Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that developers can leverage to simplify and 
speed up web development. Popular libraries and frameworks include jQuery, Angular, and Vue.js.

Back-End Development: With the introduction of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, 
allowing developers to build full-stack applications using a single language.


-- Scope:
JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
Global scope Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope and accessed 
from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Function scope Variables defined inside a function are not
accessible (visible) from outside the function. Block scope Variables declared inside a { } 
block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

-- var:
var is a keyword in JavaScript used to declare function-scoped variables.
Variables declared with var can be hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope.
var allows variable redeclaration within the same scope.
-- let:
let is a keyword in JavaScript used to declare block-scoped variables.
Variables declared with let can be reassigned within their scope.
-- const:
const is a keyword in JavaScript used to declare block-scoped variables with constant values.
Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned once defined, but they can be mutable if they reference objects or arrays.

-- SET INTERVAL
setInterval is used when you want to execute a function repeatedly at a certain interval / duration, Same as setTimeout(),
but repeats the execution of the function continuously.

-- SET TIMEOUT
setTimeout is used when you want to execute a function once after a certain delay, Executes a function after waiting a 
specified number of milliseconds.


-- What is a Promise in JavaScript?
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous 
operation and its resulting value.It provides a way to handle asynchronous operation more easily to avoiding callback hell
or prymaid of doom.

-- What are the three states of a Promise?
The three states of a Promise are pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

-- Pending: 
This is the initial state of a Promise. When you create a Promise, it starts in a pending state. At this point, the asynchronous operation is 
still ongoing, and the Promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

-- Fulfilled (Resolved): 
A Promise is said to be fulfilled when the asynchronous operation it represents has successfully completed. 
When a Promise is fulfilled, it transitions to this state, and the then methods success callback is invoked.

-- Rejected: 
A Promise is said to be rejected when the asynchronous operation it represents encounters an error or fails for some reason. 
When a Promise is rejected, it transitions to this state, and the catch or then methods error callback is invoked.

-- What are the two main methods used to handle Promises?
The two main methods used to handle Promises are then() and catch().

-- How do you create a new Promise in JavaScript?
You can create a new Promise in JavaScript by using the Promise constructor and 
passing in a function that takes two parameters: resolve and reject. 
The resolve function is called when the operation is successful and 
the reject function is called when there is an error.

-- What is the difference between a Promise and a callback function?
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion of an asynchronous operation, 
while a callback function is a function that is called when an asynchronous operation is complete.

-- How do you chain multiple promises together? OR PROMISE CHAINING
You can chain multiple promises together by using the then() method to return a new promise. 
Each then() method takes a callback function that returns a new value or a new promise.

-- What is Promise.all() and when would you use it?
Promise.all() is a method that takes an array of promises as input and returns a new promise that
is fulfilled when all of the promises in the input array are fulfilled. You would use 
Promise.all() when you need to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and wait for
all of them to complete before moving on to the next step.

-- What is Promise.race() and when would you use it?
Promise.race() is a method that takes an array of promises as input and returns a new promise that is 
fulfilled or rejected as soon as the first promise in the input array is fulfilled or rejected. 
You would use Promise.race() when you need to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and 
only need the result of the first operation that completes.

-- What is the purpose of the finally() method in a Promise?
The finally() method in a Promise is used to specify a callback function that is executed regardless of 
whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. The finally() method is typically used to perform cleanup 
operations, such as closing a database connection or releasing a resource, after the promise has completed.

-- How do you handle errors in Promises?
You can handle errors in Promises by using the catch() method to specify a callback function
that is executed if the Promise is rejected. The catch() method takes a single parameter, 
which is the error object or message that was returned by the Promise

-- Hoisting
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the 
compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in your code, 
which may seem counter intuitive.
Variable declarations (var) are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. However, only the declarations are hoisted, 
not the initializations. This means that the variable is technically available from the beginning of the scope, but its value will be undefined 
until the point in the code where its actually assigned a value.

console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;

Function declarations (not function expressions) are also hoisted to the top of their containing scope. This means you can call a 
function before its defined in the code.


sayHello(); // Output: "Hello!"
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

-- Temporary Deadzone
Its important to note that this behavior applies to var declarations and function declarations but not to let and const declarations. 
Variables declared with let and const are hoisted to the top of their containing block but 
arent initialized until their actual declaration in the code. This is known as the "temporal dead zone."
(or)
TDZ stands for Temporal Dead Zone in JavaScript. Its a phase that occurs when using the let and const variable declarations. 
During the Temporal Dead Zone, a variable is technically declared but cannot be accessed or used. Accessing the variable in this state will 
result in a ReferenceError. The variable becomes accessible only after it has been officially declared in the code.

-- Async/Await:
Async/await provides a more synchronous-looking syntax for handling asynchronous operations. The async keyword is used to declare a 
function as asynchronous, and the await keyword is used to pause execution until a promise is get resolved or reject.

-- Destructuring
Destructuring in JavaScript is a way to extract values from objects and arrays and assign them to variables more conveniently, 
making code cleaner and more readable.Its particularly useful when working with complex data structures and is widely used in 
JavaScript for tasks like data extraction, parameter passing, and variable assignment.

-- local storage
Local Storage allows you to store larger amounts of data (usually up to around 5-10 MB) in a 
key-value format. The data stored in Local Storage persists even after the browser is closed and 
can be accessed across browser sessions. This makes it suitable for storing things like 
user preferences, settings, and cached data. The data stored in Local Storage does not have 
an expiration time and remains until its explicitly cleared by the user or the application.

-- session storage
Session Storage also allows you to store key-value pairs, but the data is limited to the 
duration of the browser session. This means that the data is available only as long as
the browser tab or window is open. Once the user closes the tab or window, the session 
storage data is cleared automatically. This makes it suitable for storing temporary data
that is only needed during a single browsing session.

----------------------REACT-------------------
-- React:

JavaScript Library: React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs). 
It is specifically focused on creating interactive and reusable UI components.

Component-Based: React promotes a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into small, 
self-contained components. Each component has its own state and behavior, making it easier to manage complex UIs.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the actual DOM. 
Instead of directly modifying the DOM, React calculates the most efficient way to update it, improving performance.

One-Way Data Binding: React enforces a one-way data flow, which means data flows from parent components to child components. 
This helps maintain predictability and reduces bugs in large applications.

Popular in Front-End Development: React is widely used for front-end web development and is often combined with other tools and libraries, 
such as Redux for state management and React Router for routing.

-- Advantages of React
The key features of React include its use of a virtual DOM, its component-based architecture, its ability 
to handle state management, its support for server-side rendering, and its modular and reusable code.

-- Disadvantages of React
Its a steep learning curve for beginners and that need for additional library and tools to complete a full featured web application.

-- What is React and what problem does it solve?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create complex UIs 
using a component-based approach. The main problem React solves is the need for efficient rendering of 
dynamic content, such as user input, without having to reload the entire page.

-- How does React use the virtual DOM to improve performance?
React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM called the virtual DOM. When changes are made to
the UI, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version, and only updates the actual
DOM where necessary. This minimizes the number of expensive DOM operations, resulting in improved performance.

-- How does the component-based architecture in React work?
In React, a component is a self-contained block of code that manages its own state and can be composed with 
other components to create complex UIs. Components can be either functional or class-based, and can be 
nested within one another.

-- What is JSX and how does it work with React?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript 
code. It works with React by enabling developers to write declarative code for creating and manipulating 
components (or) it is commonly used in react to describe the structure and content of a components UI.

-- How do you handle state management in React?
State is managed in React using the state object, which can be updated using the setState() method. 
State should be used for data that changes frequently and needs to be managed by the component itself.

-- What is the React Router and how does it work?
React Router is a library that allows you to handle client-side routing in React applications. It provides a way to 
navigate between different pages or views in a single-page application (SPA) without causing a full page refresh.
It allows developers to define routes, which are mapped to specific components, 
and to handle navigation between those routes using various methods, such as links or programmatic navigation.

-- How do you test React components?
React components can be tested using various tools, such as Jest or Enzyme. Tests can be written to 
ensure that components render correctly, that they handle user input correctly, and that they update state 
correctly.

-- How do you optimize performance in React?
Performance in React can be optimized by using the shouldComponentUpdate() method to minimize unnecessary 
re-renders, by using pure components, by using React.memo(), and by using code splitting to reduce the 
size of the JavaScript bundle.

-- Can you explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React?
Lifting state up is the process of moving state from a child component to its parent component in order 
to share it with other child components. This can be useful for managing state that is used by multiple 
components, or for passing data between sibling components.

-- What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
Controlled components are components that have their state managed by the parent component, while 
uncontrolled components have their state managed by the DOM. Controlled components can provide more 
control over the behavior of the component, while uncontrolled components can be simpler to implement

-- What is the difference between Props and State in React?
Props (short for properties) and State are both used to pass data to components in React, but they serve 
different purposes.

Props are read-only data that are passed from parent components to child components. They are immutable, 
meaning they cannot be modified within the component that receives them. This makes them useful for 
configuring components and passing data down the component tree.

State, on the other hand, is used to manage data that changes within a component. It is mutable, meaning it 
can be updated within the component that owns it. This makes it useful for keeping track of things like user 
input or the state of a toggle button.

-- What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new 
component with additional functionality. HOCs are most popular & modern pattern in React for code reuse and 
abstraction in simply we can say they allow us to reuse component logic across the multiple components.

HOCs can be used to:

Inject additional props into a component
Wrap a component with additional markup or behavior
Provide context to a component

For example, if you have a component that needs to make an API call, you could create an HOC that handles the API call and passes the data down 
as props to the component. This allows you to abstract away the API logic and reuse it in other components. 

-- What is Redux?
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized store for managing 
the state of your application, which allows you to manage your applications state in a predictable and scalable way,
and it provides a way to update and access that state,which can be accessed by all components in the application.

Redux uses a pattern called "unidirectional data flow" to manage state. This means that state changes 
must be triggered by actions

By using Redux, It also provides a way to share state between components without having to 
pass props down the component tree.
Redux works by using a combination of actions, reducers, and a store. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes to 
the application state, reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action and return a new state, and 
the store is the object that holds the application state and provides methods for accessing and updating it.

-- What is React ContextAPI?
ContextAPI is a feature in React that allows you to pass data down the component tree without having to 
pass props through each level of the tree. It provides a way to share data between components that are 
not directly connected.

Context consists of two parts: a Provider and a Consumer. The Provider component allows you to specify the 
data that you want to share, and the Consumer component allows you to access that data from any level in 
the component tree.

-- What is the difference between React and React Native?
React application are built for the web,while React Native applications are built for iOS and Android devices.

React is a JavaScript library for building web applications, while React Native is a framework for building 
native mobile applications using JavaScript and React.

React and React Native share many similarities, such as the component-based architecture and the use of 
JSX syntax. However, there are some key differences between the two:

React applications use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the UI, while React Native uses native UI components.
React Native provides a set of pre-built components specifically designed for mobile devices, such as <ScrollView> and <TextInput>.
While React and React Native have some similarities, they are designed for different use cases and require different tools and development 
workflows.

-- What are React hooks?
React hooks are functions that allow you to use React features, such as state and lifecycle methods, 
in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to simplify the process of using 
stateful logic in functional components.

Some of the most commonly used React hooks include useState, which allows you to add state to a functional 
component, useEffect, which allows you to perform side effects such as data fetching or DOM manipulation, 
and useContext, which allows you to access context in a functional component.

React hooks are typically used in functional components, which are simpler and easier to read and maintain 
than class components. They allow you to use state and other React features without having to convert your 
functional components into class components.


-- What is the virtual DOM in React?
The virtual DOM is a programming concept that is used in React to improve the performance of web applications. 
It is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model), which is the data structure that represents 
the content and structure of a web page in the browser.

The virtual DOM is a representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in memory. 

When you update the state of a component in React, the virtual DOM is updated to reflect the changes, 
but the actual DOM is not updated immediately. Instead, React compares the previous virtual DOM with 
the updated virtual DOM to determine what changes need to be made to the actual DOM. 
This process is called reconciliation, and it is what allows React to update the UI in an efficient and 
performant way.

By using the virtual DOM, React minimizes the number of updates that need to be made to the actual DOM, 
which can be slow and resource-intensive. This makes React applications faster and more responsive, 
especially when dealing with large amounts of data.


-- What is a React hook?
React hooks are functions that allow you to use React features, such as state and lifecycle methods, 
in functional components.Previously, state could only be managed in class components using the setState() method.

Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. 
Some of the most commonly used hooks include:

**useState: This hook allows you to manage state in a functional component.

**useEffect: This hook allows you to run side effects, such as fetching data from an API, when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.

**useContext: This hook allows you to access context in a functional component.

Hooks provide a number of benefits over class components, including improved code readability, better performance, and easier testing. 
They also allow you to write more reusable and composable code, which can help to improve the maintainability of your application.

-- useRef
The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.

It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause any re-render when its gets updated.

It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

It is a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

Refs can be used to call methods or access properties of a component instance or a DOM node.

-- useState
useState is a built-in hook in React.

useState takes one argument, which is the initial value of the state variable.

useState returns an array with two values: the current value of the state variable, and 
a function to update the value.

The state variable can be of any data type, such as a string, number, boolean, object, or array.

Updating the state variable using the update function triggers a re-render of the component, causing any 
changes in the UI to reflect the updated state.

-- useEffect
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

Some examples of side effects are: fetching data from API, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

The function passed to useEffect can return a cleanup function, which is used to cancel.

-- useReducer
The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.

By default we use useState,  when the state logic becomes more complex switch to useReducer 

The useReducer Hook returns the current state and a dispatch method.


-- useCallBack
One reason to use useCallback is to prevent a component from re-rendering unless its props have changed.

-- React JSX
JSX(JavaScript XML)is syntax extension of JS that allows you to write HTML-like code in React components.

Note that JSX elements must be wrapped in parentheses when used in a function, and attribute names must be
in camelCase instead of kebab-case, as in regular HTML. Also, JSX expressions can contain JavaScript 
expressions in curly braces, which are evaluated at runtime.

-- usage of keys
React, keys are used to identify unique items in a list of elements that are being rendered dynamically. 
When rendering a list of elements in React,key wants to include for each element to track the elements changes
or we miss to give key for the elements it takes the ID as a key by default

-- component life cycle
Mounting - This phase occurs when a component is created and added to the DOM for the first time. 
Updating - This phase occurs when the state or props of a component change, triggering a re-render
Unmounting - This phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM.
 
-- Functional Components or Stateless
functional component in react are the simply JavaScript function that return a react element, they do not have state or 
lifecycle methods and are used for simple, stateless components, For simple UI rendering, stateless components are
preferred as they are easier to understand and maintain.

-- Class components or Statefull
Class component in react have the access to state and lifecycle method and are used for more complex, stateful components.
For complex UI interactions and logic, stateful components are preferred as they can handle the logic and data management 
in a centralized and organized way.

-- props drilling
Props drilling is a term used in React when you have a component that needs to pass data to its 
child component, but that child component is not directly related to the parent component inorder to share the data
to pass the same props down through several levels of components, even if some of those components 
dont use the props themselves. This is called props drilling.

-- Brouser router
It is a type of router that uses to keep track of the URLs and renders the appropriate component based 
on the current URL.

-- switch
It is a component that allows grouping Route components and rendering only the first one that matches the 
current URL. This is useful when defining routes that have similar paths but different components to render.

-- Link: 
It is a component that allows creating links to other pages in the application. 


--------------------MYSQL-----------------

-- What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
SQL is a language used for managing and querying relational databases data,while MySQL is one of the RDBMS software that uses SQL as its language.

-- What is MySQL?
MySQL is a versatile open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It stores data in tables. Every table is made up of rows and 
columns that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and access data in a database.

-- What is a primary key in MySQL?
A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. 
It ensures that the data is unique and helps in faster querying.

-- what is a foreign key in mysql?
A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that refers to the primary key 
or a unique key of another table. It is a link between two tables.This helps to maintain 
consistency and accuracy of data in the database.

-- What is normalization in MySQL?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. 
It the process of dividing larger tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them.

-- What is a stored procedure in MySQL?
A stored procedure is a pre-written SQL code that is stored in the database and can be executed repeatedly. 
It is used to encapsulate and execute complex logic, reduce network traffic, and enhance performance.

-- What is the difference between a join and a subquery in MySQL?
A join combines two or more tables based on a common column, while a subquery is a query nested within another query. 
Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables, while subqueries are used to retrieve data from one or more tables and use 
it to filter data in another query.

-- What is the difference between MyISAM and InnoDB storage engines in MySQL?
MyISAM is an older storage engine in MySQL that is suitable for read-heavy applications and supports full-text searching. 
InnoDB is a more recent storage engine that is designed for transactional applications and supports features such as row-level 
locking and foreign keys.

-- How can you optimize MySQL performance?
There are several ways to optimize MySQL performance, such as using indexes to speed up queries, avoiding subqueries and joins, 
optimizing database schema design, caching frequently accessed data, and using a caching layer such as Memcached or Redis.

------------------MONGODB---------

-- What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. 
It is a popular choice for building web applications because of its flexible data model and scalability.

-- What is a document in MongoDB?
In MongoDB, a document is a basic unit of data storage. It is a JSON-like data structure that contains 
key-value pairs. Documents are stored in collections and can have varying structures and fields which it means Each document can have a 
different structure,these different structure making it flexible for handling various types of data.

-- What is a collection in MongoDB?
A collection in MongoDB is a group of related documents that are stored together. It is similar to a 
table in a relational database. Collections do not enforce a schema and can have varying structures and fields.For example, 
you might have a database for an e-commerce application with collections for products, orders, and customers.

-- What is a database in MongoDB?
A database in MongoDB is a container for collections and which means this is the top-level container for your data. 
It is similar to a database in a relational database system. Each database can have multiple collections and can be 
hosted on a single MongoDB server or on multiple servers.

-- What is sharding in MongoDB?
Sharding in MongoDB is a process of horizontal scaling in which data is distributed across multiple servers 
or shards. It allows for improve performance and scalability of a database system.

-- What is indexing in MongoDB?
Indexing in MongoDB is a way of optimizing queries by creating a data structure that allows for faster 
data retrieval. Indexes can be created on single or multiple fields in a collection and can significantly 
improve query performance.

-- What is replication in MongoDB?
Replication in MongoDB is a process of creating copies of data across multiple servers or nodes in a cluster. 
It provides high availability and data redundancy in case of node failures.

-- What is aggregation in MongoDB?
Aggregation in MongoDB is a way of processing data and returning results in a structured format. 
It allows for complex data analysis and can be used for tasks such as data mining, statistical analysis, 
and reporting.

-- What are the data types in MongoDB?
MongoDB supports a variety of data types, including strings, integers, doubles, booleans, dates, regular 
expressions, arrays, and documents.

-- What is the difference between MongoDB and SQL databases?
MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database, while SQL databases are relational databases that store 
data in tables. MongoDB does not enforce a schema and allows for more flexible data modeling, while SQL
databases require a fixed schema. MongoDB is designed for scalability and can handle large amounts of 
unstructured data, while SQL databases are better suited for structured data and complex queries


----------------NODEJS------------


-- What is Node.js and how does it work?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chromes V8 engine. It allows 
developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling them to create scalable and high-performance web applications. 
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

-- What is an event loop in Node.js?
The event loop is a core component of Node.js that handles all the asynchronous and I/O operations. It listens for events and 
executes the appropriate callback function when an event occurs. The event loop is responsible for managing the flow of execution 
and ensuring that the program runs efficiently.

-- What is the purpose of Node Package Manager (npm)?
Node Package Manager (npm) is a package manager for Node.js that allows developers to easily manage and share packages of code. 
It provides a central repository for Node.js packages and makes it easy to install and update packages as needed. npm is also used to
manage project dependencies and to create, publish, and share Node.js packages.

-- What are the benefits of using Node.js?
Some of the benefits of using Node.js include:

It is built on JavaScript, which is a widely-used language that many developers are familiar with.
It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it highly scalable and efficient.
It has a large and active community that contributes to the development of packages and libraries.
It can be used for both front-end and back-end development, making it a versatile technology.
It is open-source and free to use, which makes it accessible to developers of all levels.

-- What are callbacks in Node.js?
In Node.js, callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when 
the original function has completed its task. They are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, such as 
reading from a file or making a database query. Callbacks allow Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, 
which makes it highly efficient and scalable.

-- What is the purpose of the module.exports object in Node.js?
The module.exports object in Node.js is used to define the public API for a module. It allows developers to specify which functions, objects, or variables should be made available to other modules that require it. By default, Node.js modules are encapsulated, meaning that their internal functions and variables are not accessible to other modules unless they are explicitly exported using module.exports.

-- What is middleware in Node.js?
Middleware in Node.js refers to a series of functions that are executed in the request-response cycle of an application. 
Middleware functions can access and modify the request and response objects, and can also invoke the next middleware function in the chain. 
Middleware is commonly used to handle tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

-- What is a stream in Node.js?
A stream in Node.js is an abstract interface for working with streaming data. It is used to handle large amounts of data that cannot be processed all at once, such as network data or file data. Streams provide a way to read or write data incrementally, in small chunks, rather than loading the entire data into memory at once.

-- What is clustering in Node.js?
Clustering in Node.js refers to the technique of using multiple Node.js processes to handle incoming requests. 
Clustering allows an application to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and to scale horizontally, increasing its capacity to 
handle more traffic. Clustering is commonly used in production environments to ensure high availability and performance.

-- What is the purpose of the buffer class in Node.js?
The buffer class in Node.js is used to handle binary data, such as images, audio, and video files. 
It allows developers to read, write, and manipulate.
